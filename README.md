# React Countries App

## Description
This is a [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io) challenge. The challenge was to take pictures and an API to make the app. The challege doesn't give you any code or markup, just a deisgn, a link to the API they want to use, and a few tips. I used react with react-router-dom since there were mutliple distinct pages. 

## Challenges
One challenge was the drop down to search by region. The styling of the <select> tage wasn't adequate to meet the design, so I had to import a package which created a more customizable drop down.

## Possible Improvements/What I learned
I learned a lot about the implementation of responsive elements. I thnk I should've used a mobile first design for this app.
