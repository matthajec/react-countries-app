# React Countries App

## Description
This app consumes data from the restcountries.eu countries API and displays it to the user. There is search functionality as well the ability to switch between a dark and light theme. It is a frontendmentor.io challege, it was built from screenshots and basic styling information such as font sizes and colors.

## Challenges
One challenge was the drop down to search by region. The styling of the <select> tage wasn't adequate to meet the design, so I had to import a package which created a custom mode customizable drop down.

## Possible Improvements
Implementing theme was unnecessarily time-consuming because I had to make styles for multiple things that were the same. I think a better solution would be to have classes that are soley for theme and can be added to any element to easily give it a certain style.
